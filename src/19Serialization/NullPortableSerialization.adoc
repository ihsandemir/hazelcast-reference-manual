==== Null Portable Serialization

Be careful when serializing null portables. Hazelcast lazily creates a class definition of portable internally
when the user first serializes. This class definition is stored and used later for deserializing that portable class. When
the user tries to serialize a null portable when there is no class definition at the moment, Hazelcast throws an
exception saying that `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.HazelcastSerializationException: Cannot write null portable
without explicitly registering class definition!`. 

There are two solutions to get rid of this exception. Either put
a non-null portable class of the same type before any other operation, or manually register a class definition in serialization configuration as shown below.

```java
Config config = new Config();
final ClassDefinition classDefinition = new ClassDefinitionBuilder(Foo.factoryId, Foo.getClassId)
                       .addUTFField("foo").build();
config.getSerializationConfig().addClassDefinition(classDefinition);
Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
```

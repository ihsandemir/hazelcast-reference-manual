=== Comparison Table

Below table provides a comparison between the interfaces listed in the previous section to help you in deciding which interface to use in your applications.

|===
|Serialization Interface|Advantages|Drawbacks

|Serializable
|- A standard and basic Java interface 

- Requires no implementation
|- More time and CPU usage
-
 More space occupancy

|Externalizable
|- A standard Java interface

- More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable
|- Serialization interface must be implemented

|DataSerializable
|- More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable
|- Specific to Hazelcast

|IdentifiedDataSerializable
|- More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable

- Reflection is not used during deserialization
|- Specific to Hazelcast 

- Serialization interface must be implemented

- A Factory and configuration must be implemented

|Portable
|- More CPU and memory usage efficient than Serializable

- Reflection is not used during deserialization

- Versioning is supported

- Partial deserialization is supported during Queries
|- Specific to Hazelcast 

- Serialization interface must be implemented

- A Factory and configuration must be implemented

- Class definition is also sent with data but stored only once per class

|Custom Serialization
|- Does not require class to implement an interface

- Convenient and flexible

- Can be based on StreamSerializer ByteArraySerializer
|- Serialization interface must be implemented

- Plug in and configuration is required

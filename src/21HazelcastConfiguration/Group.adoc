=== Group Configuration

This configuration is used to create multiple Hazelcast clusters. The cluster members (nodes) and clients having the same group configuration (i.e., the same group name and password) forms a private cluster. 

Each cluster will have its own group and it will not interfere with other clusters. The name of the element to configure cluster groups is `group`.

The following are example configurations.

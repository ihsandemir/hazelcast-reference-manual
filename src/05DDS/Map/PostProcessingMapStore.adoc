===== Post Processing Map Store

In some scenarios, you may need to modify the object after storing it into the map store.
For example, you can get an ID or version auto generated by your database and then you need to modify your object stored in the distributed map but not to break the sync between database and data grid. You can do that by implementing the `PostProcessingMapStore` interface to put the modified object into the distributed map. That will cause an extra step of `Serialization`, so use it only when needed. (This explanation is only valid when using the `write-through` map store configuration.)

Here is an example of post processing map store:

```java
class ProcessingStore extends MapStore<Integer, Employee> implements PostProcessingMapStore {
  @Override
  public void store( Integer key, Employee employee ) {
    EmployeeId id = saveEmployee();
    employee.setId( id.getId() );
  }
}
```

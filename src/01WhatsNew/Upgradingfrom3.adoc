==== Upgrading from 3.x


In this section, we list the changes what users should take into account before upgrading to latest Hazelcast from 3.x versions.

- **Introducing the `spring-aware` element:**
By default, Hazelcast uses `SpringManagedContext` to scan `SpringAware` annotations. This may cause some performance penalties even if the users do not use `SpringAware`. 
By introducing the `spring-aware` element, now it is possible to disable it by adding the `<hz:spring-aware enabled="false"/>` tag to the configuration. Please see the <<spring-integration, Spring Integration section>>.

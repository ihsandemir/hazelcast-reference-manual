Clustered JMX via Management Center allows you to monitor clustered statistics of distributed objects from a JMX interface.

==== Clustered JMX Configuration

In order to configure Clustered JMX, use two command line parameters for your Management Center deployment.

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.enabled=true` (default is false)
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.port=9000` (optional, default is 9999)

With embedded Jetty, you do not need to deploy your Management Center application to any container or application server.

You can start Management Center application with Clustered JMX enabled as shown below.

```
java -Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.enabled=true -Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.port=9999 -jar mancenter-3.3.jar
```

Once Management Center starts, you should see a log similar to below.

```
INFO: Management Center 3.3
Jun 05, 2014 11:55:32 AM com.hazelcast.webmonitor.service.jmx.impl.JMXService
INFO: Starting Management Center JMX Service on port :9999
```

You should be able to connect to Clustered JMX interface from the address `localhost:9999`.

You can use `jconsole` or any other JMX client to monitor your Hazelcast Cluster. As a sample, below is the `jconsole` screenshot of the Clustered JMX hierarchy.

SemaphoreConfig semaphoreConfig = config.getSemaphoreConfig();

|=========================


It has below elements.

* `initial-permits`: the thread count to which the concurrent access is limited. For example, if you set it to "3", concurrent access to the object is limited to 3 threads.
* `backup-count`: Number of synchronous backups.
* `async-backup-count`: Number of asynchronous backups.

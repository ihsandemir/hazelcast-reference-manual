[[reuse-address]]
==== Reuse Address

When you shutdown a cluster member, the server socket port will be in the `TIME_WAIT` state for the next couple of minutes. If you start the member right after shutting it down, you may not be able to bind it to the same port because it is in the `TIME_WAIT` state. If you set the `reuse-address` element to `true`, the `TIME_WAIT` state is ignored and you can bind the member to the same port again.

The following are example configurations.

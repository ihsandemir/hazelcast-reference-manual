=== Hazelcast Cluster Discovery

A Hazelcast cluster is a network of cluster members that run Hazelcast. Cluster members (also called nodes) automatically join together to form a cluster. This automatic joining takes place with various discovery mechanisms that the cluster members use to find each other. Hazelcast uses the following discovery mechanisms.

* <<multicast-auto-discovery, Multicast Auto-discovery>>
* <<discovery-by-tcp, Discovery by TCP>>
* <<ec2-cloud-auto-discovery, EC2 Cloud Auto-discovery>>

Each discovery mechanism is explained in the following sections.

	
NOTE: After a cluster is formed, communication between cluster members is always via TCP/IP, regardless of the discovery mechanism used.

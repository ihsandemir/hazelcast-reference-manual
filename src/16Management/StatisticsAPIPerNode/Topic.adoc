==== Topic Statistics

The `ITopic` interface has a `getLocalTopicStats()` method which returns a
`LocalTopicStats` object that holds local topic statistics.


```java
HazelcastInstance node = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
ITopic<Object> news = node.getTopic( "news" );
LocalTopicStats topicStatistics = news.getLocalTopicStats();
System.out.println( "number of publish operations = " 
    + topicStatistics.getPublishOperationCount() );
```

Below is the list of metrics that you can access via the `LocalTopicStats` object.

```java
/**
 * Returns the creation time of this topic on this member
 */
long getCreationTime();

/**
 * Returns the total number of published messages of this topic on this member
 */
long getPublishOperationCount();

/**
 * Returns the total number of received messages of this topic on this member
 */
long getReceiveOperationCount();
```

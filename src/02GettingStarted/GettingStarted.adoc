==== Hazelcast


You can find Hazelcast in standard Maven repositories. If your project uses Maven, you do not need to add additional repositories to your `pom.xml` or add `hazelcast-<version>.jar` file into your classpath (Maven does that for you). Just add the following lines to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----------------------------------------
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
		<artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
		<version>3.4</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----------------------------------------


As an alternative, you can download and install Hazelcast yourself. You only need to:

-   Download `hazelcast-<version>.zip` from http://www.hazelcast.org/download/[www.hazelcast.org].

-   Unzip `hazelcast-<version>.zip` file.

-   Add `hazelcast-<version>.jar` file into your classpath.

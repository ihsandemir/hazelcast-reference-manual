===== Write Through

`MapStore` can be configured to be write-through by setting the `write-delay-seconds` property to *0*. This means the entries will be put to the data store synchronously.

In this mode, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns:

* `MapStore.store(key,value)` is successfully called so the entry is persisted.
* In-Memory entry is updated.
* In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other JVMs (if `backup-count` is greater than 0).

The same behavior goes for a `map.remove(key)` call. The only difference is that  `MapStore.delete(key)` is called when the entry will be deleted.

If `MapStore` throws an exception, then the exception will be propagated back to the original `put` or `remove` call in the form of `RuntimeException`.
